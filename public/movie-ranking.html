<h1>The Best Movies According to Danny</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108358/">Tombstone</a></h3>
<img src="../assets/images/Tombstone photo.png" alt="Wyatt, Morgan, Virgil Earp and Doc Holliday headed for the OK Corral" height="300">
<p>This is my favorite western. Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday may be my favorite acting performance of all time.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090728/">Big Trouble in Little China</a></h3>
<img src="../assets/images/Jack Burton.png" alt="Jack Burton" height="300"><p>This is my overall favorite film. The perfect balance of fantasy, action, comedy, and martial arts film genres.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055614/">West Side Story</a></h3>
<img src="../assets/images/West Side Story.png" alt="Tony and Maria" height="300">
<p>Bar none the greatest musical of it's time, and as a Shakespeare lover it is a wonderful adaptation of Rome ond Juliet</p>
